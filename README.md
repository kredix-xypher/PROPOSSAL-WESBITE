# 💖 Proposal Website

This is a romantic interactive **proposal website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Three.js + animations)**.  
It creates a magical atmosphere with floating hearts, petals, confetti, and a special question:

> **"Will You Marry Me?"**

## 🌹 About

💌 I built this for someone who meant the world to me.
But sometimes… love doesn’t come back the way we give it. 💔

I lost the one I loved, yet through this project, a part of that love still lives.
Maybe it couldn’t be our story, but it can still become your story.

Take this, shape it with your own feelings, and let it be the bridge to someone’s heart.
Because even if I couldn’t keep mine, I hope you can create a memory that lasts forever. ✨❤️
